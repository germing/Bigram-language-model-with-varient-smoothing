# Bigram-language-model-with-varient-smoothing

### To see the evaluation of the model, you can either run '''tester.py''' or the shell script '''run''' by changing the parameter of the model. 

The evaluation shows the perplexity on the training and test set. 
The evaluation also shows the correct percentage of solving jumble sentences task. The jumble sentences task is to find a real sentence out of 10 jumbled sentences. 

From evaluation, my bigram model is giving accuracy of 97.3%. My bigram model with add one smoothing is giving accuracy of 97.8%. My bigram model with linear interpolation is giving accuracy of 98.4%.
